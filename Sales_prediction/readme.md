# Sales Prediction
This project aims to predict sales using three different machine learning models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The project includes steps for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and compare the performance of different regression models to predict sales based on historical data. The project involves:

### Loading and preprocessing data.
Training three different machine learning models.
Evaluating the models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Visualizing the actual vs. predicted sales for each model.
Installation
To run this project, you need to have the following software and libraries installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

### Usage
Clone the repository or download the Sales_Prediction.ipynb file.
Open the Sales_Prediction.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.
Models and Evaluation
The notebook includes the following steps:

### Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the dataset using Pandas.
Preprocess the data (handle missing values, feature scaling, etc.).

##### Model Training:
Train three different regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM.

#### Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Visualize the actual vs. predicted sales for each model.
Results
The notebook provides a detailed comparison of the three models based on their performance metrics. The results are visualized using scatter plots, showing the actual vs. predicted sales.

###### Example output:

Linear Regression Mean Squared Error: 1.3277
Linear Regression Mean Absolute Error: 1.4651
Decision Tree Mean Squared Error: 1.3277
Decision Tree Mean Absolute Error: 1.0125
SVM Mean Squared Error: 1.7886
SVM Mean Absolute Error: 1.4651
